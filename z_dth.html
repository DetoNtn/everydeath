	<p class="intro">what is <b>z_everydeath</b>?<br>
		<br>
		a stupid little webcomic i haphazardly made while daydreaming.<br>i chose it because originally i was going to name this series<br>"<b>myeverydeath</b>". i still really like this idea, and i am literally <br> keeping room in my webcomic, before even making it all real, <br> so i can account for it. so, pretend that i already made it<br>and that it's definitely in the canon of this universe. <br> there's supposed to be super cool names, <br> like <b>youreverydeath</b> and <b>theireverydeath</b> and different continuities <br> that these lil storylines coexist in. so far, not made. <br> i plan to make it though :) <br>
		<br> one day, it'll all come out. <br>
		<br>
		anyways here have leftover art for caring
