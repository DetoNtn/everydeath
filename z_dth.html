	<p class="intro">what is <b>z_everydeath</b>? <i>(aka <b>lette's story</b></i>)<br>
		<br>
		a stupid little webcomic i haphazardly made while daydreaming.<br>i chose it because originally i was going to name this series<br>"<b>myeverydeath</b>". i still really like this idea, and i am <br> keeping room in my webcomic, before even making it all real, <br> so i can account for it. so, pretend that i already made it<br>and that it's definitely in the canon of this universe. <br> there's supposed to be super cool names for it all,<br> like <b>youreverydeath</b> and <b>theireverydeath</b> and different pieces<br> that these lil storylines form a puzzle with. <br> i plan to make it happen though :) <br>
		<br> one day, it'll all come out. <br>
		<br>
		anyways here have leftover art for caring
